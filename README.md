## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Other than the Anaconda distribution of Python versions 3 particularly those loaded into the notebook, there's no need for any other libraries to successfully run the code. A copy of the original dataset posted [here](https://www.kaggle.com/gabrio/board-games-dataset) was downloaded into my local machine to analyse. 

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For my first project under the Data Science Nanodegree by Udacity, I was interested in analysing a dataset containing all board games and expansions showcased and rated in BoardGameGeek's website. I came across this dataset published by Gabriele Baldassarre on Kaggle.

The goal of this analysis is to explore *what makes a great board game*? To do this, we will answer 3 business questions:

1. What correlates to a board game's rating?
2. How does a game's complexity affect its rating?
4. Are complex board games considered popular?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The project has one Jupyter Notebook file and a README file.  A copy of the original dataset posted [here](https://www.kaggle.com/gabrio/board-games-dataset) was downloaded into my local machine to read and analyse. 

All code required for this project is encapsulated within the notebook cells including util functions. Markdown cells and comments are used to thoroughly describe my analysis.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at my Medium blogpost available [here](https://mitraganeson.medium.com/one-game-to-rule-them-all-d3bd1049148d).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

I'd like to acknowledge Gabriele Baldassarrre for publicly providing an amazing dataset with high potential for all kinds of data science experiments. I was very much inspired by his exploratory analysis and other users' contributions, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/gabrio/board-games-dataset/code).

I'd also like to thank to Josh Bernhard for his detailed lessons on conducting the CRISP-DM process and publishing our findings. You can find more of his interesting work [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774).
